# About Me 

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Anfaal Mahbub, a third-year software engineering student at the Schuilich School of Engineering. I'm passionate about coding and love tackling complex challenges.

I'm fluent in Python, C/C++, and Java, and I'm currently exploring the world of assembly language to deepen my understanding of software development.

On the front-end, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive user experiences. You can check out my projects to see my skills in action.

I believe in the power of collaboration and value diverse perspectives. Let's connect and create innovative software solutions together! Reach out to me at anfaal.mahbub@ucalgary.ca or find me on LinkedIn [linkedin.com/in/anfaal-mahbub-b0baa71b1]. Let's redefine what's possible in the world of software engineering!
